This is an app for creating and tracking flights in either X Plane or MSFS.

It is written in C# and .NET 9 using a WPF Blazor Hybrid Framework. For styling, FluentUI for Blazor is used. The backend uses Microsoft Entity Framework 9 and MySQL Entity Framework for connecting to a MariaDB database. Also works with MySQL 8.
